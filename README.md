# Instructions
- fork/clone this repo


### Notes
- For the Word Frequencies Program to work you must use Node Version 8.2.1 or newer.
- I am not familiar with Python, nor BeautifulSoup so I am not sure if the cheerio module like it. The internet says cheerio is more like jQuery so I used it. If it is the Node version of BeautifulSoup, I have failed part of the specs for this project, but am submitting as-is because these two problems took me a good few hours on their own.
